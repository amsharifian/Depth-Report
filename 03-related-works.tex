High-level synthesis (HLS) techniques~\cite{jcong_hls,canis_2011_legup, vivado} have been proposed to improve the productivity of hardware designers by automatically generating the hardware from a high-level description of an application. An HLS tool, ideally, (i) captures various types of parallelism in the input application, (ii) builds the design space of various micro-architectures that exploit the parallelism, and (iii) explores the design space to find the micro-architecture with the lowest silicon area and/or power consumption.

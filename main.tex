%   DOCUMENT CLASS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Use the `sfuthesis` class to format your thesis. If your program does not
%   require a thesis defence, use the class option `undefended` like so:
%
%     \documentclass[undefended]{sfuthesis}
%
%   To generate a signature page for your defence, use the `sfuapproval` class
%   instead, by replacing the below line with
%
%     \documentclass{sfuapproval}
%
%   For more information about thesis formatting requirements, go to

%
%   or ask a thesis advisor at the SFU Research Commons.

%   PACKAGES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Add any packages you need for your thesis here.
%   You don't need to call the following packages, which are already called in
%   the sfuthesis class file:
%
%   - appendix
%   - etoolbox
%   - fontenc
%   - geometry
%   - lmodern
%   - nowidow
%   - setspace
%   - tocloft
%
%   If you call one of the above packages (or one of their dependencies) with
%   options, you may get a "Option clash" LaTeX error. If you get this error,
%   you can fix it by removing your copy of \usepackage and passing the options
%   you need by adding
%
%       \PassOptionsToPackage{<options>}{<package>}
%
%   before \documentclass{sfuthesis}.
%
%   The following packages are a few suggestions you might find useful.
%
%   (1) amsmath and amssymb are essential if you have math in your thesis;
%       they provide useful commands like ``blackboard bold'' symbols and
%       environments for aligning equations.
%   (2) amsthm includes allows you to easily change the style and numbering of
%       theorems. It also provides an environment for proofs.
%   (3) graphicx allows you to add images with \includegraphics{filename}.
%   (4) hyperref turns your citations and cross-references into clickable
%       links, and adds metadata to the compiled PDF.
%   (5) pdfpages lets you import pages of external PDFs using the command
%       \includepdf{filename}. You will need to do this if your research
%       requires an Ethics Statement.

%   OTHER CUSTOMIZATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Add any packages you need for your thesis here. We've started you off with
%   a few suggestions.
%
%   (1) Use a single word space between sentences. If you disable this, you
%       will have to manually control spacing around abbreviations.
%   (2) Correct the capitalization of "Chapter" and "Section" if you use the
%       \autoref macro from the `hyperref` package.
%   (3) The LaTeX thesis template defaults to one-and-a-half line spacing. If
%       your supervisor prefers double-spacing, you can redefine the
%       \defaultspacing command.
%

\frenchspacing                                    % (1)
\renewcommand*{\chapterautorefname}{Chapter}      % (2)

\begin{abstract}
In recent years, the computing landscape has seen an increasing shift towards specialized accelerators.
Reconfigurable architectures like FPGAs are particularly promising for accelerator implementation as they can offer performance and energy efficiency improvements over CPUs and GPUs and are more flexible than fixed-function ASICs.
Unfortunately, adoption of reconfigurable hardware has been limited by their associated tools and programming models:
hardware description languages (HDLs) lack abstractions for productivity and are difficult to target directly from higher level languages.
The alternative to HDLs to support higher level of abstraction is High-level synthesis (HLS) tools.

HLS techniques have been proposed to improve the productivity of hardware designers by automatically generating the hardware from a high-level description of an algorithm.
In HLS tools, front-end captures system behavior with a model of computation in a standard language such as C, C++, SystemC as an input.
The language components, in this case, are in the form of untimed mathematical expressions and nested, pipeline and parallel loops.
And then, the compiler schedules the input algorithm and applies optimizations such as inner loop pipelining, unrolling, memory banking and buffering to generate RTL.

The purpose of this work is first to have a clear definition of hardware accelerators and different level of abstraction to express a design. Then we look at state-of-the-art HLS approaches to automatically synthesis hardware from the higher-level description of an algorithm.
Finally, we look at the limitation of each technique and outline what we believe is the main challenge with the current HLS techniques.
